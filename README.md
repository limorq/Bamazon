# Bamazon

This is an Amazon-like storefront using mySQL that will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the stor's inventory. The app has two programs, one for customers and one for managers.

The customer app will show users a list of available products for sale and ask for their choice. Once the user has selected their choice, they will be asked the quantity of their choice. The app will then verify product availabbility and then process the order by updating inventory and showing the user the amount due.

If there is not enough inventory for the customer's order, a message displays informing the customer ther is an insufficient quantity and allows them to choose again.
